This is a lookalike website similar to hotstar,netflix or other OTT platform website.

Description: This is a front-end lookalike website created to seem like Hotstar OR any other OTT platform
             website.

Working: The website contains two pages, the front page and the second linked page and both of the oages contains navigation and footer bar.
         
   Page 1: There is an image slider in the middle and at the nav bar the movies sections is a hyperlink that redirects to the movies page which is the second page.
         
   Page 2: The second page which is the movies section contains the nav and footer bar and the list of movie items listed by the genre.
           There is also a search functionality which works like this for e.g if we search batman then batman would show up ,if naruto then naruto would show up and 
           if batwoman then batwoman will show up. As of now the search functionality works for the three mentioned searches,will try to add more further.
